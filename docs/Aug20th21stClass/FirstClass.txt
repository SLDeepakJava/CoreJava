TypeCasting :


int i = 10;			int j = 2.5;
double d = 20.4;		double  d1 = 10;
char c = 'A';			

homogenous assignment		heterogenous assignment

Typecasting : converting one type to another type is called 
typecasting in java.

Typecasting :
1) Primitive Casting -- converting one primitive datatype to another
2) Derived Casting -- converting one object type to another 


Primitive Casting :

1) Auto widening -- converting lowest data type to highter datatype
2) Explicit Narrowing --converting highest datatype to lowest datatype
