different between static and non-static :

1)use static if you want all the instance to use the same value 
2)use non-static if you want to provide different values for each object 

1)if i want to access a variable without creating a object then go for static
2)if i want t access variable using object then go for non-static


memory management :

1) a class a executed in java the memory allocated will be divided into two areas:
Stack -- LIFO -- sotring local variables and methods 
Heap -- storing objects
2)while running a class ,java calls the class loader , the class loader loads
all the static members into the heap.
the pool of static members is called as static area or static pool.
static members are loaded only one time for entire execution
3)The non-static members are loaded into the memory during creation of object
each instace or object will get one copy of static members.
4)an object of class can be created multiple times.



Constuctor are used to initilize the non-static members
1) every class will have atleast one constructor
2) if developer does not write any constrcutor then java will provide a default
constructor , Employee() {}.
3)constructor will get called durign object creation
4)constrcutor will not have any return types

this is a keyword ,used to refer current object members

we can have a multiple constructor but it shoudl vary in terms of no of arg
in same class is called as constructor overloading
