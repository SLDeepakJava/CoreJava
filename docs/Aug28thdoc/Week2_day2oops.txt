Oops :

1)Encapsulation
2)Inheritance -- 
3)abstract and interface 

super() and this()

a class extending multiple class is called as multiple inheritance
java does not support multiple inheritance in class

diamond problem with mutliple inheritance
multiple inheritance can be achieved thorught interface


from java 8 onwards we can have a method with body in interface,
those method should be defined with default keyword.

in interface we can achieve multiple inheritance



Polymorphism : one name many forms 
--- two types polumorphism:
1)compile time or static binding 
ex: method overloading
2)runtime time or dynamic binding
ex: method overriding 


Final is a keyword
a variable declared using final ,the value cannot be changes
a class defined using final ,cannot be inherited
a method defined using final ,cannot be overrided


Object class is the super most class of all clasess
if a class does not extend any class then by default it will
extend Object class
Object class contains below methods:
toString()
equals()
sleep()
wait()
clone()
hashCode()


--------------------
String -- it is a class

StringBuffer
StringBuilder

by default all methods in string buffer are synchronized 
stringbuilder is faster 
---------------

arrays are object in java
arrays are used to store multiple values of same datatype

syntax:
primitive/object[] arrVariable = new primitive/object[size];

arrays are not growable and they are static in nature
once we define the size ,we cannot change
