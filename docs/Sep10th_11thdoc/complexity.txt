efficeincy depends :

no of lines of code
the amount of memory or backing storage needed
time taken to execute the program


the execution time depends on :
the size of the data set
number of comparisons made

function O() of N, the no of elements to be processed

common expressioare O(N) , O(N2) and O(Log2 N) 


O(N) -- linear search
means that the number of comparisons increases directly with
the number of items.

O(log2 N) -- binary search
